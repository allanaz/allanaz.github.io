          <p>I'm a software engineer with over 3 years of experience building tools used by progressive organizations and democratic campaigns.</p>
          <p>Recently I've been particularly focused on payment processing, helping my former colleagues at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ngpvan.com">NGP VAN</a> improve their payment processing infrastructure with Stripe, and adding new
          payment methods like Venmo and PayPal. Other projects included advocacy tools facilitating public comments on proposed government regulations, a tool
        for customizing the appearance of supporter facing donation forms, and a refactoring of email unsubscribe workflows.</p>
          <p>Before that, I was a student at MIT, majoring in Physics and Computer Science and Engineering. When I wasn't studying, I worked with
            a congressional campaign, built telescope control software, and developed educational games for middle school students. I was also involved
            in running the largest undergraduate technology club on campus, in particular leading a research competition for high school students.
          </p>
          <p>I grew up in Oceanside, CA, and currently live in Washington, DC. I enjoy photography, reading, and traveling as often as I can. </p>
